**1. Project Cold Storage - Evaluated the impact of change in temperature of Cold Storage products during the year**

Statistical Methods for Decision Making -  The project computed the mean cold storage temperature in different seasons and used hypothesis testing to evaluate if any corrective action is required from the plant's side or the procurement's side.

Skills and Tools - Descriptive Statistics, Inferential Statistics, Estimation & Hypothesis Testing

2. Market Segmentation in the context of Product Service Management

Advanced Statistics - The project involves performing Factor Analysis as well as Regression Analysis on a certain set of variables. It also requires to take independent variables and perform some correlation matrix to find out if there is any high correlation. Multiple Linear Regression has been performed by taking Customer Satisfaction as the dependent variable and the four factors as the independent variables.

Skills and Tools - PCA/FA, Multiple Linear Regression, Multicollinearity

3. Building a supervised Model to cross-sell personal loans

Data Mining - The objective of this exercise was to build a model using a Supervised learning technique to figure out profitable segments to target for cross-selling personal loans. A Pilot campaign data of 20000 customers was used which included several demographic and behavioral variables. The Model was further validated and a deployment strategy was recommended.

Skills and Tools - Random Forest, Data Mining, Pruning, Model Performance Measures

4. Analysing Customer Churn problems of Telecom Companies

Predictive Modeling - The project involves analyzing certain issues of customer churn faced by telecom companies. It requires simulating a case of customer churn using techniques such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes. Models are required to be build so as to predict whether a customer will cancel their service in the future or not and then model comparison measures are made for taking interpretation and recommendations from the best model.

Skills and Tools - Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Model Comparison Measures

5. Choosing preferable mode of transport by employees

Machine Learning - The project involves deciding on the mode of transport that the employees prefer while commuting to the office. For this, multiple models such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression have been created and explored to check their model performance metrics. Bagging and Boosting modeling procedures have also been applied to create the models.

Skills and Tools - Bagging & Boosting, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression

6. Build a forecasting model to predict monthly gas production

Time Series Forecasting - The project involved developing an ARIMA model to forecast the monthly Australian gas production level for the final 12 periods.

Skills and Tools - ARIMA, Time Series Forecasting, ADF Test

7. Creation of an India Credit Risk Default Model Using Logistic Regression

Finance and Risk Analytics - The project involved developing a credit risk default model using a given data that had to be checked for outliers, missing values, multicollinearity, etc. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis had to be conducted and the model had to be built using Logistic Regression on most important variables. Model Performance Measures were undertaken that included predicting the accuracy of the model on certain datasets.

Skills and Tools - Logistic Regression, Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, Outlier Treatment, Model Performance Measures


8. Visualizing Car Insurance Claims using Tableau

Data Visualization using TABLEAU - This project explored the art of problem-solving with the aid of visual analytics. Tableauâ€™s data visualization tools were used to create interactive dashboards to provide high-level insights into an Insurance company to drive the company's car insurance schemes.

Skills and Tools - Data Visualisation, Tableau, Business Intelligence


9. CAPSTONE PROJECT - Predicting the Department wide Sales for a Retail Chain

Retail Data Analytics - A Retail Chain wanted to take strategic decisions by predicting sales for its stores for next year while analysing the impact of markdowns on sales. This would help boost consumer spends on retail, during holidays, using right range of markdowns in the right department and prioritize stores/departments with highest business impact.A regression model was created using multiple variables such as historical sales data, stores type/size, macro-economic indicators , promos and markdowns etc.

Skills and Tools - Decision Trees, Random Forest, TABLEAU, Ensemble, Linear Regression

Conclusion - Predicted the department-wide sales for each store for the following year and Modeled the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks.Multiple models were created using Linear Regression,SVM, Random Forest, Decision trees , XGBoost .XGBoost was chosen as the best model post comparing KPI's such as Rsquare, RMSE, MSE . Provided recommended actions by analyzing the sales trends including predicted sales, with prioritization placed on the largest business impact.

10. Recommending ways to increase revenue of a Coffee Chain

Marketing & Retail Analytics - The project involves conducting a thorough analysis of Point of Sale (POS) Data for providing recommendations through which a coffee chain restaurant can increase its revenue by either taking off certain items from the menu or coming up with popular combo meals for customers.

Skills and Tools - Market Basket Analysis, Churn Rate Prediction, RFM Analysis
